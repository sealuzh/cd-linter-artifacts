# Badges

We apply for the following badges: `available`,  `functional`, and `reusable`.

Our artifacts are publicly accessible from an archival repository ([Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/)) and have a DOI. For this reason, we think that our paper is eligible for the `available` badge.

We also carefully described all the artifacts generated during our study and linked them to relevant sections in the paper. Those artifacts are also exercisable. For these reasons, we apply for the `functional` badge.

Finally, we detailed all the steps required to install and exercise our artifacts. While we chose our study as the use case, other researchers can employ the produced documentation to easily reuse our artifacts in the context of a different study. Thus, we also apply for the `reusable` badge.
