# The problem is that to be able to use go get, one needs to put
# the repository in the $GOPATH. So for example if your gitlab domain
# is mydomainperso.com, and that your repository is repos/projectname, and
# the default GOPATH being /go, then you'd need to have your
# repository in /go/src/mydomainperso.com/repos/projectname 
# Thus, making a symbolic link corrects this.
