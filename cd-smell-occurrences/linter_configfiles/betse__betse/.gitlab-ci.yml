# --------------------( SYNOPSIS                          )--------------------
# Project-wide GitLab-CI configuration, integrating the in-house
# free-as-in-beer continuous integration (CI) service exposed by GitLab with
# this project's "py.test"-driven test suite. GitLab-specific terminology used
# by this service includes (from highest- to lowest-level):
#
# * GitLab-CI, GitLab's high-level CI service coordinating project-specific and
#   shared Runners with projects - including project artefacts and metadata.
# * Runner, a low-level virtual machine conforming to the GitLab Runner API and
#   acquiring builds to process through the GitLab-CI coordinator API. There
#   exist two categories of Runners:
#   * Project Runners, hosted either directly by project maintainers on private
#     servers *OR* indirectly by for-profit intermediaries on private servers
#     paid for by the project maintainers. As the nomenclature implies, Project
#     Runners are specific to and hence accessible by only the project to which
#     they are assigned. In either case, "paid" and "private" are the general
#     keywords here. (Inapplicable for our use case.)
#   * Shared Runners. As the nomenclature implies, Shared Runners are
#     accessible to all projects on a GitLab instance. Hence, all projects
#     hosted by the official gitlab.com host share access to the same Shared
#     Runners. Shared Runners are hosted either:
#     * If the GitLab instance hosting this project is *NOT* the official
#       gitlab.com, then by the prior mechanisms (e.g., by project maintainers
#       or for-profit intermediaries).
#     * If the GitLab instance hosting this project is the official gitlab.com,
#       then by the for-profit intermediary with whom gitlab.com has partnered:
#       as of this writing, DigitalOcean. In this and only this special
#       edge-case, Shared Runners are free-as-in-beer for both public and
#       private repositories hosted with this instance. An inevitable caveat,
#       of course, is that only Linux-based Shared Runners are available. To
#       quote the official response to a recent issue report requesting both OS
#       X and Windows support:
#       "If you are writing about shared runners on GitLab.com, then they are
#        only Linux based (with docker executor). If you need Windows, Mac or
#        any other OS for the runner, then you need to install it on your own
#        host and register it in your project on GitLab.com."
#
# This gitlab.com-hosted project has been configured to enable Linux-based
# Shared Runners. Exercising tests on either OS X or Windows requires doing so
# on an external third-party free-as-in-beer CI service specific to that
# platform and then integrating this service with GitLab.

# For a list of all available Docker images, see the search bar at the top of
# "https://hub.docker.com". To find relevant images, consider (in order):
#
# * Either:
#   * Google "docker python3 matplotlib". Since Matplotlib transitively
#     requires most dependencies required by this project, this query
#     (typically) yields maximally relevant images.
#   * Search the Docker Hub Registry directly by:
#     * Switching the list box from its useless default of "All" to either
#       "Downloads" or "Stars", sorting hits on image usage or upvotes.
#     * Searching for "python". Unfortunately, since the search engine *ONLY*
#       searches image names rather than some combination of names,
#       descriptions, and/or Dockerfiles, the resulting hits tend to be only
#       minimally relevant.
# * For each image of interest, clicking the "Tags" subpage to list:
#   * All available tags for that image.
#   * For each such tag, the compressed filesize of that tagged image.
#
# All else being equal, the smallest image pre-packaging the largest number of
# dependencies required for our scientific stack is the most ideal. Note that
# downloading and installing dependencies via a package manager is
# significantly slower than merely downloading an image pre-packaging those
# dependencies.
#
# Docker official images are rumoured to be switching from an Ubuntu- to an
# Alpine Linux-based OS. Thanks to an obsessive-compulsive attention to
# minification, Alpine Linux is ideal for Docker-based CI. While Alpine Linux
# comes bundled with a package manager ("apk") providing a variety of
# scientific Python packages (e.g., "py-numpy"), these packages are all sadly
# built against the non-standard musl libc implementation optimized for Alpine
# Linux rather than the standard glibc libc implementation bundled with most
# Linux distributions. Technically, a glibc compatibility layer for musl named
# "gcompat" does exist but appears to be inapplicable to Python usage. In any
# case, musl is effectively incompatible with glibc and hence "manylinux"
# Python wheels -- which, by de facto industry standard, are linked against
# glibc rather than musl. So, Alpine Linux-based Docker images are entirely
# inappropriate for Python usage and *MUST* strictly be avoided. See also:
#     https://github.com/docker-library/docs/issues/904
#     https://pythonspeed.com/articles/base-image-python-docker-images
#
# Consensus in the open-source Python community strongly advises use of the
# official Python images published by Docker themselves in their so-called
# "slim" variants (e.g., "python:3.7-slim-buster"), which officially support
# *ALL* modern stable releases of Python. Moreover, these images are stable,
# well-maintained, and minified almost as extremely as Alpine Linux Docker
# images but with *NONE* of the disadvantages of the latter. See also:
#
# * Docker Hub Registery entry for this image:

# A name is an alphanumeric label such that:
#
# * For third-party Docker images, the name is prefixed by an organization name
#   delimited by a "/" character (e.g., "continuumio/anaconda3").
# * For official Docker images published by Docker itself, the name is a bare
#   label prefixed by *NO* such delimiter (e.g., "python").
#
# A tag is an alphanumeric label unique to an image, whose name is itself an
# alphanumeric label unique across all images registered at the Docker Hub
# Registery. A tag typically specifies the version of that image to be used.
#
# Lastly, note that the test matrix defined below explicitly overrides this
# basic image for every test environment. This is only a desperate fallback.

# List of all stages to be run by this pipeline (in order).
#
# In Gitlab-CI parlance, a "stage" is an abstract tag to which a "job" (defined
# below) is assigned. Each job is *ALWAYS* tagged with exactly one stage,
# defaulting to the "test" stage. All jobs tagged with the same stage are run
# in parallel *BEFORE* all jobs tagged with the next stage in this list are run
# in parallel. If any job fails, the entire stage to which that job belongs
# fails. If any stage fails, the entire pipeline fails; else, the pipeline
# succeeds.
#
# Previously, this pipeline listed the following two stages:
#
#     stages:
#       - build
#       - test
#
# These stages were implemented by the following two jobs:
#
# * "betse_build", implementing the "build" stage by installing dependencies.
# * "betse_test", implementing the "test" stage by testing this application.
#
# Sadly, this seemingly reasonable partition of the pipeline workflow silently
# ceased working at some unidentifiable time in the development history. To
# remedy this, all work previously previously performed by the "betse_build"
# job is now performed as a global "before_script" key. While non-ideal, there
# appears to be no remedy as yet.
stages:
  - test

# ....................{ JOBS                              }....................
# In Gitlab-CI parlance, a "job" is a container of all Gitlab-CI configuration
# metadata guaranteed to be enabled for the same duration of the pipeline time.
# This contradicts conventional *nix-oriented parlance, in which a "job" is
# simply a subprocess owned by a parent shell process.
#
# Each Gitlab-CI job is uniquely identified by a top-level user-defined key of
# this YAML file *NOT* already reserved for use as a top-level official key by
# the ".gitlab-ci.yml" file format (e.g., "artifact", "cache", "script"). A job
# may have any arbitrary non-reserved name and may contain any top-level
# official key, thus confining the action of that key (e.g., artifact building,
# caching, script commands) to that job.

  # we do so anyway.

    #
    # This command *MUST* be run before attempting to install any dependencies
    # via the system-wide package manager, as the latter requires the package
    # cache created by the former. If omitted, the first such attempt fails

    - apt-get update --quiet --quiet --yes

    # Install all dependencies available via the system-wide package manager.
    # Doing so is typically both faster and stabler than doing so via "pip"
    # and, in any case, supports installation of non-Pythonic dependencies
    # unavailable via "pip" (e.g., "graphviz").
    - apt-get install --quiet --quiet --yes ${_APT_PACKAGE_NAMES}

# Note that non-slim Docker Python images are currently preferred to slim

# latter fail to include C and C++ compilers required to build and install
# wheels for Python packages both lacking official wheels *AND* containing
