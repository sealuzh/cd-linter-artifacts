# This file specifies how GitLab should run the tests, linting and other checks
# automatically when merge requests are opened. By default, this will all run
# on GitLab provided "shared runners", without further work. However, the tests
# will run more quickly on a "specific runner" if you'd like to set that up.
#
# If you'd like to provision your own specific runners for your fork of the
# repository, you can use these Ansible roles:
